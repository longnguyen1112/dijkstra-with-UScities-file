# Dijkstra Algorithm

Hi this is my class work. We implemented Dijkstra Algorithm using C++. With a menu provided, this will allow user to load a file of cities with distance and time between (or enter manually). With that being set up, the program will be able to find the shortest distance and shortest time with the specific direction.
